U04 is a very good example on the phi-scan angle comparisons. A03 is also ok. U3 us also a good example.


U06 is an example of how I can conclude that it's not the same grain


U05 is a good example of change from polycrystalline to single crystalline after treatment


V01 is a very good example on the 2theta-scan before and after treatment 


Should illustrate that tilt makes the phi-peaks disappear
